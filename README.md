# LSTM-STOCK-MARKET-ANALYSIS
üìà LSTM Stock Market Analysis
A deep learning project that predicts stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This project leverages historical stock market data to train and evaluate an LSTM model for time series forecasting.

üîç Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets. This project applies LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data.

Key steps include:

Collecting historical stock price data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance)

Preprocessing and normalizing the data

Creating LSTM-compatible data sequences

Training an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras

Evaluating predictions visually and statistically

üß† Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)

 Future Improvements
Use more complex LSTM architectures (e.g., stacked or bidirectional)

Include other technical indicators (MACD, RSI, etc.)

Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
