# LSTM-STOCK-MARKET-ANALYSIS
üìà LSTM Stock Market Analysis
A deep learning project that predicts stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This project leverages historical stock market data to train and evaluate an LSTM model for time series forecasting.

### üîç Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets. This project applies LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data.

### Key steps include:

* Collecting historical stock price data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance)

* Preprocessing and normalizing the data

* Creating LSTM-compatible data sequences

* Training an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras

* Evaluating predictions visually and statistically

### üß† Technologies Used


1. Python

2. TensorFlow / Keras

3. NumPy

4. Pandas

5. Matplotlib

6. scikit-learn

7. Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)

 ### Future Improvements
- Use more complex LSTM architectures (e.g., stacked or bidirectional)

+ Include other technical indicators (MACD, RSI, etc.)

* Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation

* Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
